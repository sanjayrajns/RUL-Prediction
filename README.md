# ðŸ”‹ Battery Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction

This project predicts the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries using machine learning models such as Ridge Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. It uses NASAâ€™s Battery Dataset and extracts features like voltage, current, temperature, and internal resistance (Re, Rct) to estimate battery health over charge/discharge cycles.

An interactive Streamlit app is included so users can input battery parameters and instantly get RUL predictions.

# ðŸš€ Features

Extracts features from raw NASA battery cycling data.

Implements multiple ML models:

Ridge Regression (Baseline)

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor (best performer)

Model comparison with MSE and RÂ² plots.

# ðŸ“Š Visualizations
1. Battery Cycle Parameters
We plotted measured voltage, current, temperature, and charge/discharge behaviors during one cycle to understand the raw data.

# 2. Model Performance â€“ MSE Comparison
Compared the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of Ridge, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

# 3. Model Performance â€“ RÂ² Score

Evaluated how well each model explains variance in RUL predictions using the RÂ² score.

# 4. Predicted vs Actual RUL

Scatter plots were generated to compare true RUL values vs model predictions for all three models. This helps visualize accuracy and bias.
